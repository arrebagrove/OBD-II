OBD-II
======

Cross platform library for communicating with OBD-II devices.

The core of the project is the IVehicleDataProvider interface and its implementations BluetoothObdiiAdapter, WifiObdiiAdapter, ObdiiSimulator, etc. Platform specific code (like Bluetooth communication) will be provided in platform specific projects.

This is a work in progress and I hope to get some help from the community. Thanks for the help and I hope you get some use out of it too!
